                    <p>AppleJack was so distracted that she didn't see the tangled maze in front of her, andâ€¦ Oh no! Now she is lost and cannot find her way out!
                        Every maze worthy of its name has a monster protecting it - oh no, it's a Domokun! It is now very angry and is chasing our little friend.
                        Will you help our trapped pony find her way through the maze and rescue her from the Domokun?</p>
                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <p>Using the arrow keys in your keyboard, help AppleJack (yellow) reach the exit (green ball) and escape the monster (brown).</p>
                    <p>You can increase the game's difficulty in the settings panel.</p>
